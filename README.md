## What is array ?

**An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.**

## How an Array is initialized?

**EX: in c++ language .**
int arr[ 5 ] = { };
**or**
int arr[ 5 ] = { 1,2,3,4,5};

**Items in array can be accessed directly by its index**
**EX: in c++ language .**
cout<<arr[2];

## Types of arrays :

- One-dimensional array (1-D arrays)
- Multidimensional array

## Advantages of using arrays:

- Arrays allow random access to elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster
- Arrays have better cache locality which makes a pretty big difference in performance.
- Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name.

## Disadvantages of using arrays:

- once you have declared the array you canâ€™t change its size because of static memory allocation

## opreations on array include:

- Insertion
- Deletion
- search
- Traverse
- Update
